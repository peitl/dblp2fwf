# DBLP to FWF report

Convert your DBLP-listed publications (or from a local .bib file) into a format suitable for inclusion into an [FWF](https://fwf.ac.at) report. Call like

	python3 dblp2fwf.py <your-DBLP-id>

with your [DBLP id](https://blog.dblp.org/2020/08/18/new-dblp-url-scheme-and-api-changes/), and don't forget to double-check and clean the output. See `python3 dblp2fwf.py -h` for a few more options.

You need to install [PyBTeX](https://pybtex.org/), with `pip install pybtex`, and Python 3.6+.
